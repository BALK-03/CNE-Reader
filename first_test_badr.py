# Page segmentation modes:
#   0    Orientation and script detection (OSD) only.
#   1    Automatic page segmentation with OSD.
#   2    Automatic page segmentation, but no OSD, or OCR. (not implemented)
#   3    Fully automatic page segmentation, but no OSD. (Default)
#   4    Assume a single column of text of variable sizes.
#   5    Assume a single uniform block of vertically aligned text.
#   6    Assume a single uniform block of text.
#   7    Treat the image as a single text line.
#   8    Treat the image as a single word.
#   9    Treat the image as a single word in a circle.
#  10    Treat the image as a single character.
#  11    Sparse text. Find as much text as possible in no particular order.
#  12    Sparse text with OSD.
#  13    Raw line. Treat the image as a single text line,
#        bypassing hacks that are Tesseract-specific.

# OCR Engine modes:
#   0    Legacy engine only.
#   1    Neural nets LSTM engine only.
#   2    Legacy + LSTM engines.
#   3    Default, based on what is available.
